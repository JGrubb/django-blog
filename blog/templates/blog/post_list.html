                    This blog began life as a chronicle of my life inside a touring band with a music/business idea. The
                    early days were me writing about letting go of an old dream so that I could have a new one.
                    Then it sort of turned into an autobiography
                    of the last 8 or so years of my life - moving from the music business into the tech
                    business, fatherhood, life and all that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the last 8 years I've worked with, thought about, and written about a variety of web
                    technologies - Drupal, Rails,
                    Linux, AWS.
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnygrubb">My LinkedIn resume is here.</a> I still think and
                    occasionally write about the music business and other personal things but I think
                    it's about to turn into a blog about learning Python for web and doing "data stuff".

                    So welcome and please have a look around.
